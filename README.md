# Cookiecutter Flowdapt Plugin

This is a [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) template for a [Flowdapt](https://flowdapt.ai) plugin. This is for easily getting started building plugins without worrying about best practices for project structure.

To get started, ensure you have the `cookiecutter` tool installed:

```bash
pip install --user cookiecutter
```

Finally, run the following command:

```bash
cookiecutter https://gitlab.com/emergentmethods/cookiecutter-flowdapt-plugin.git
```

You will be prompted to enter some information about your plugin, then the template will be rendered to a new folder with the name you specified.
